# SkData

## Project Purpose

*Please summarize your project in 140 characters or less.  For example: “Colper Science is a podcast, YouTube channel and blog about the benefits of open science (e.g., open data, open source, etc.) in research.”*

Scikit-data aims: reduce boilerplate code, reduce time spent on data analysis tasks and offer a reproducible data analysis workflow.


## Describe the issue/problem you are trying to address

*Please explain how your project resolves issues around open innovation, efficiency in regards to practicing open science (lower barriers, ease of use & integration, etc), and/or reproducibility (transparent research methods & results).*

Generally, there is a lot of boilerplate code on data analysis task that could be resolved with reproducible mechanisms and easy data visualization methods. Another point is related to data publish. A lot of data analysts doesn't know about open data repositories or doesn't consider that in his/her scientific workflow communication.

The main issues that scikit-data (or just skdata) should resolves: 

* integration with open data repositories to publish data;
* reproducibility on data analysis tasks through storing and recovery steps;

SkData should integrate with the main data analysis/manipulation libraries on Python.


## List key project activities (what will you do), outputs (what will be produced through your activities, e.g. products, publications, number of workshops held and people trained) and outcomes (impact of your project on your beneficiaries during the grant period). (5000 Characters)

*Additionally, please include: How will you make these products openly available? What license will you assign to published materials?*

All code should be licensed by MIT license and texts should be licensed by CC-BY 4.0.

The project should be structured using a open research workflow. Innitially, it is expected to be used: Open Science Framework (OSF), Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS), figshare, dataverse and GitHub.

The expected project activities are:

* Workflow definition;
* Research about data analysis tasks;
* Data collection;
* Propose and prototype an integration between skdata and some open data repositories (at least one);
* Propose and prototype reproducibles mechanisms to be used on data analysis;

The expected outputs are:

* Research texts available on OSF and GitHub;
* Pre-print publication;
* Academic article published at some open journal;
* Library publication at JOSS;
* Code available on GitHub;
* Images used published on figshare;
* Data collected published on dataverse;

The expected outcomes are:

* Data analysis time spent reduced;
* Data analysis methods applied more transparent;
* Improve data analysis workflow through reproducible mechanisms.

## Provide key indicators you plan to use to measure project outcomes and source of data. (2500 Characters) 

*Please be specific as possible. Additionally, please include: What does success look like for this project?*

To measure the outcomes, will be used a survey. 

Before to start the survey, the surveyed should read the instructions to use the skdata library.

After install and use the library, the surveyed will answer a few questions (10 questions expected).

This question should measure impacts on data analysis task, such as: 

* time spent;
* integrability;
* reproducibility;
* usability;


## Explain who will benefit from the project and how you will engage with them. (2500 Characters) 

*Additionally, please include: What are the communication platforms you will be using for engagement? If you’re hosting any workshops or events, are you charging participants to attend?*

Data scientist, data analysist and scientist in general could be benefited using skdata library. 

The communication platforms that will be expected to be used are:

* Twitter;
* Telegrams groups, such as: Scientific Python Groups, Data Python Groups, etc;
* Research Gate;


## Describe the geographic location(s) in which this project will be implemented. (2500 Characters)

*Additionally, please include: In which city or cities will this project take place? What geographic areas will be impacted and benefited by your project?*

This project there is no geographic limitation, it can be used by any people around the world.


## List any risks or challenges that may affect the overall success of your project, and note how Mozilla and/or others can help you to overcome these challenges. (1250 Characters)  

The main challenge of this project is:

* define mechanisms to integrate into data analysis tasks to offer a minimum impact;

When necessary, it should be used online communities to discuss these subjects.


## List your project partners, if any, and the role they will play in the project. (2500 Characters) 

None.


## Mozilla works in the open. How will you document and share your project progress with the community?

The documentation should be done in the follow format:

* Markdown files should be used to explain technical issues, such as: installation, how to contribe, etc;
* tex files should be used for paper and report;
* Sphinx and Readthedocs should be used as a technical documentation;

The project will be stored in a GitHub repository and the Open Science Framework (osf) platform should be used to connect repositories used by the project.


## Are other organizations working toward outcomes similar to those described in this proposal? If yes, explain how your work complements that of others or fills a key gap. (1250 Characters)

There is other projects similars but fragmented:

* OpenRefine can be used for data cleaning and for data analysis steps share (reproducibility);
* The Python libraries (such as Blaze, Dask, Pandas) there are great methods for data analysis;
* PivotTables.js, PixelDust and Weka projects there are very interesting methods for interactive data visualization.

SkData should create a mechanism to integrate the main Python libraries (mainly Pandas) with reproducibility data analysis method (like OpenRefine) and a very interactive data visualization like PivotTable.js in Jupyter Notebook environment.


## Describe how this project fits into your organization’s mission and goals. (1250 Characters) 

*Science Mini Grants are for individuals, not organizations. You may skip this question.*

## Is this a new project or a continuation? If new, please describe your qualifications to initiate the activity. If continued, please describe your accomplishments to date. Feel free to include links to articles and documents online that highlight your recent work. (1250 Characters)


## How will you continue work on this project beyond this funding period? (1250 Characters)

*Additionally, please include: How will you encourage others to support this program? How might this work be scaled and spread to other organizations or to other cities?*

## Have you previously partnered with Mozilla? Have you previously received a grant from Mozilla? If so, please list title, amount, and purpose. (1250 Characters)
